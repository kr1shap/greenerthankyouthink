## **Overview**  

**getting started!** is a group of __adolescents__ who understand the challenges of navigating mental health while facing life‚Äôs changes. 
Many struggle to express their emotions due to the fear of judgment, making it difficult to seek support. 
Our mission is to create a safe space where adolescents can unwind, share their feelings, and find relief from negative emotions.
This is why we created **Greener than you think**, a friendly, cute web application as a comfort zone for adolescents. Want to have your own mini garden? Let your thoughts go?
Then, **Greener than you think** is your to go! __Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side. __ (À∂ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇÀ∂) .·êü.·êü 

This was a project made for ElleHacks 25.

## **Features**  
- **Mood checker**: Simple, yet important. Asking anyone, 'How do you feel?' is important because they are heard and known. As such, we have implemented a simple mood checker that asks for your mood. As turn, their garden is updated with your mood (this specific part has not been implemented).
- **Let your thoughts fly away**: Sometimes, we need to rant about how we feel. This is why we have a thought bubble, where you can write **anything** about how you feel, and let your thought fly away!
- **And finally, your garden**: Although not fully implemented, the main feature is having your garden. Click the plants you grew, name them, and be able to interact with them! For now, each plant holds a special quote, saying or fact regarding your mental health. It may be inspirational, wholesome, or important to know for adolescents.
- **Cutesy, indie-game style**: The overall aesthetic for this is a 'cutesy' vibe for all adolescents to feel comfortable using. Lots of pixel art is used for an 'indie-like' style.
